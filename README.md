## Demo: To query database
Send Get request to : http://13.212.160.201:8001/search?q="search_parameter" where "search_parameter" is the topic you would like to query. An array of corresponding question numbers will be returned.

Example: http://13.212.160.201:8001/search?q="Ribosomes"

Output is an array of questions that fall below "Ribosomes" in the database.
